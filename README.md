# CodeQuizWebSite

A "brutal code quiz" testing players' JavaScript knowledge.

The quiz is based upon the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie BloodSport as learning JavaScript and going to coding boot camp are similar to full contact, underground, mixed martial arts tournaments where fights to the death may occur.  

Users are presentd with questions and buttons to provide responses.  The code heavily features API/DOM Tree navigation and manipulation via JavaScript to create dynamic HTML.  THe JavaScript invokes if statements and eventlisteners extensively.  Perhaps there is a more efficient and DRY way to refactor this code, but the code utilizes concepts taught up to this point in the course and shows the logic behind the website's operation.

All of the comments in the code are my own, inserted to document pseudocoding the rationale for the code.
