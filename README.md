# CodeQuizWebSite

A "brutal code quiz" testing players' JavaScript knowledge.

The quiz is based upon the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie BloodSport as learning JavaScript and going to coding boot camp are similar to full contact, underground, mixed martial arts tournaments where fights to the death may occur. Seriously, though, this quiz is intended to make the coding skills of JavaScript newbies better in a fun and engaging way.  It is also intended to demonstrate my ability to create dynamic HTML pages using JavaScript and DOM Tree navigation and manipulation. 

Users are presentd with questions and buttons to provide responses.  The code heavily features API/DOM Tree navigation and manipulation via JavaScript to create dynamic HTML. Care was given to ensure the clock runs and displays correctly on screen.  The JavaScript invokes if statements and eventlisteners extensively.  Quiz participants are invited to save their score and initials, which persists in local storage.
